#Part A

##Question 1a

We have

$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}$$
and 

$$\bar{R}^2=1-\frac{SSR/(n-k-1)}{SST/(n-1)}$$.

Prove that $$\bar{R}^2=1-(1-R^2)(\frac{n-1}{n-k-1})$$

##Question 1c

Problems with $R^2$

- Adding more variables will never decrease $R^2$, regardless of how rubbish they are
- You can have a model which is 99% junk but still appear to have a good fit
- This is problematic when you want to choose the most important variables for your model
- The model with the most variables will always have the highest $R^2$

Advantages of $\bar{R}^2$

- A penalty is added for each variable included in the model
- $\bar{R}^2$ will only increase if the new variables adds more explanatory power than the penalty

##Question 2

The estimated equation should be 

$$price = \underset{(29.475)}{-21.7703}+\underset{(0.0006)}{0.0021}\times lotsize+\underset{(0.0132)}{0.1228}\times sqrft + \underset{(9.0101)}{13.852}bdrms$$

$$n=88, R^2=0.672, \bar{R}^2=0.661, \hat{\sigma}=59.833$$


##Question 2a

The predicted price (in thousands of dollars) is $\neg 21.7703 +0.0021 \times 10000 + 0.1228 \times 2300 + 13.8525 \times 4=337.08$

- Note, this is the same as estimating the conditional mean of a house with these characteristics
- The only difference between $E[price|lotsize=10000, sqrft=2300,bdrms=4]$ and $y_i|lotsize=10000, sqrft=2300,bdrms=4$ is the error term $u_i$
- Since this cannot be predicted, our point estimate will be the same for both
- Things change when we have an interval estimate

##The linear regression model

$$y=\beta_0 + \beta_1x+u$$

- Two components:
- Deterministic component $E(y|x)=\beta_0+\beta_1x$, aka conditional mean
- Random errors: $u$ where $u\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ (intrinsic variability)
- Running a regression gives us $\hat{y}$ which estimates $E(y|x)$
- $\hat{y}$ also estimates $y$

##Confidence interval for the conditional mean

- We need some sort of measure of how dispersed our regression lines will be around the true conditional mean 
- This is different from $\hat{\sigma}^2$ which we use to estimate $\sigma^2$, the variance of the errors
- What we want is the variance of the estimation error or $Var(\hat{y})$
- I.e. how much will $\hat{y}$ move around if we took different samples
- Also called the variance of the sampling error

##Question 2b

To calculate the confidence interval for $E[price|lotsize=10000, sqrft=2300,bdrms=4]$ we need to run a regression of $price_i$ on $(lotsize_i-10000)$,$(sqrft_i-2300)$ and $(bdrms_i-4)$. 

- The point estimate for the conditional mean will be given by the intercept of the regression
- We can also use the standard error on the intercept to get our confidence interval

##Question 2b
CI for $E[price|lotsize=10000, sqrft=2300,bdrms=4]$

$$=[337.08 \pm t_{60}(0.975)\times7.374466]=[321.96,351.46]$$

- We are 95% confident that the conditional mean for a house with these characteristics would lie in this interval
- Would we be 95% sure that the price of a house with these characteristics would lie in this interval? NO
- This only accounts for $\textit{estimation}$ uncertainty and not uncertainty due to the error term $u_i$




##Question 2cv

Now we calculate a prediction interval for a house with these characteristics.

- The point estimate will be the same, but the standard error of the prediction will have two components: estimation uncertainty and 'intrinsic' uncertainty
- There is estimation uncertainty because we don't know what $\beta$ is, only what $\hat{\beta}$ is
- There is intrinsic uncertainty, because even if we did know the true values of the $\beta$s, each observation has a random component $u$
- The standard error of prediction $var(\hat{e}_i)=\hat{\sigma}^2+[se(\hat{y}_i)]^2$
- Most of the time estimation uncertainty is small, so we can ignore $se(\hat{y}_i)$



#Part B

##Question 1a
We have a data set on the characteristics of individuals in the labour force and estimated a model of the form

$$\ln(wage) = \beta_0 +\beta_1educ + \beta_2exper +\beta_3exper^2 $$
$$+\beta_3female + \beta_4married + \beta_5urban + u$$

where female, married and urban are dummy variables.


##Question 1 Output
![](/Users/HongX/Desktop/Documents/Work Related Stuff/Monash Tutoring/ETC2410/2019/Tutorials/Week 8/Out1.png){width=320px}


- Most of these variables are statistically significant at the 5% level because their p-values are close to zero

##Question 1b
How do we interpret the estimated coefficients of the model?

$$ln(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x+u$$

- For a one unit change in x $\%\Delta y \approx \beta_1\times100$, approximation only valid if $|\beta_1|<0.1$
- The exact expression is $\%\Delta y = (e^{\beta_1}-1)\times100\%$


##Question 2

Open up the victouristquarterly.wf1 file in EViews and estimate a model of the form:

$$\ln(VIC) = \beta_0 + \beta_1T+\beta_2Q1+\beta_3 Q2 +\beta_4Q3+u$$

- T is the deterministic time trend
- Q1, Q2 and Q3 are dummy variables for each quarter of the year

Why do we not include a dummy variable for Q4? What would happen if we did?

##Question 2b

If we dropped the dummy variable Q1 and included a dummy variable for Q4, how would that affect:

- the coefficient estimates?
- $R^2$ of the model?
- SSR?

##Question 2c

Plot (by hand) the predictions of $\ln(VIC)$ across time for each of the quarters.

- These lines should all be parallel but with different intercepts 

Now, generate a new series by taking the natural logarithm of the variable VIC and create a seasonal plot

- Go to view and select graph
- In the graph options click on Seasonal Graph and press Enter

##Question 2d

Use a t-test to test the hypothesis that the true intercepts for Q2 and Q3 are equal vs the alternative they are not with $\alpha=0.05$.

- What model should we estimate to test this hypothesis?
- https://flux.qa/LDPPHD

##Question 2e

At the 5% significance level, test whether or not there exists a structural break in the intercepts for each quarter and the time trend due to the 2008 global financial crisis.

- To create the dummy variable, go to generate series and type "\@after("2008Q3")"
- Run a regression with the gfc dummy variable now included and 4 extra variables $GFC*T$, $GFC*Q1$, $GFC*Q2$ and $GFC*Q3$ 
- What is the null hypothesis that we are testing?
