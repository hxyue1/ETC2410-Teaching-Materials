#Part B

##Question 1: CAPM

$$E[R_i]-rf = \beta_i(E[R_m]-rf)$$

- Excess return of an asset is a function of the market's excess return
- While risk = return, under CAPM, you are only rewarded for taking on $\textit{systematic}$ risk and not $\textit{idiosyncratic}$ risk which can be diversified away
- How much you are rewarded by is given by $\beta$ the sensitivity of the asset's excess returns to the market's excess returns
- $\beta$ is calculated by running a regression of the asset's returns against the market's returns
- In practice the marekt portfolio will be some sort of index like the All Ords or the SP500

##Question 1a
Suppose we have the excess returns of Qantas which we denote $y_t$ and the excess returns of the All Ords $x_t$. We are interested in running a regression of the form:

$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_t+u_t, \quad t=1,..,n$$

We assume that $E[\textbf{u}|\textbf{X}] = 0$ and we use $\tilde{\beta}_1 = \frac{y_n-y_1}{x_n-x_1}$ as an estimate of $\beta_1$.

Show that $$E[\tilde{\beta}_1]=\beta_1 + E[\frac{u_n-u_1}{x_n-x_1}]$$.

Hint: In place of $y_n$ and $y_1$ substitute their expressions given by the regression model and rearrange the fraction.

##Question 1a: Continued
Using $E[\textbf{u}|\textbf{X}] = 0$ now show that $E[\tilde{\beta}_1]=\beta_1$ i.e. $E[\tilde{\beta}_1]$ is an unbiased estimate of $\beta_1$.

$$\textit{}$$
Hint: Use the fact that since $E[\textbf{u}|\textbf{X}] = 0$, then $E[\textbf{u}] = 0$. i.e. If the $\textit{conditional}$ expectation is a constant then the $\textit{unconditional}$ expectation is also a constant.

##Unbiasedness
An estimator is unbiased if the expected value of the estimator is equal to the true value of the parameter which it is trying to estimate.

- e.g. The sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of the population mean $\mu_X$ because $E[\bar{X}]=\mu_X$

In our case, we've shown that $E[\tilde{\beta}_1]=\beta_1$ so $\tilde{\beta}_1$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta_1$

- The OLS estimator is also an unbiased estimator of $\beta_1$ provided assumptions E.1, E.2 and E.3 hold

##A bit more on assumption E.3: Zero conditional mean
The assumption that $E[\textbf{u}|\textbf{X}] = 0$ is required for unbiasedness. It can seem more abstract than the other assumptions, but essentially it means that:

- The theoretical errors of our model should on average be zero, AND are not a function of the explanatory variables
- There is no correlation between the errors of our model and explanatory variables

##A bit more on assumption E.3: Zero conditional mean

E.3 can be violated when:

- We omit a variable which is associated with $\textbf{y}$ but also correlated with one or more explanatory variables in $\textbf{X}$
- e.g. A model of the form $wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1education + u$ with $ability$ omitted because we can't measure it
- We misspecify the functional form of the dependent variable
- e.g. We model $y$ as a linear function of $x$, when in fact it is also a function of $x^2, x^3,...,$ etc.

##Question 1b
Now, also assume that $Var(\textbf{u}|\textbf{X})=\sigma^2\textbf{I}_n$. 

Can $\tilde{\beta}_1$ have a smaller variance than the OLS estimator? i.e. Is $\tilde{\beta}_1$ more precise than $\hat{\beta}_{1,OLS}$? 

Hint: Use the Gauss-Markov assumptions from lecture 4 to prove or disprove this.

##Question 2

- Download the file hprice.wf1 and estimate the model 
$$price = \beta_0 + \beta_1 sqrft + \beta_2 bdrms + u$$
- What is the estimated equation?
- What is the estimated price increase for a house with one more bedroom if we hold $sqrft$ constant?
- What is the estimated price increase for a house with an additional bedroom that is 140 square feet?
- What percentage of the variation in house price is explained by sqrft and bdrms? https://flux.qa/LDPPHD
- What is the estimated price of the first house in our sample? (Use the regression coefficients)
- What is the residual of the prediction for the first observation? Does this suggest that the buyer over or underpaid?

##Question 3

- Download the bodyfat.wf1 workfile and create a scatterplot matrix between the three variables
- Based on the scatterplots, if we ran two regression with dependent variable body_fat and explanatory variable either wgk OR abdomen, what we would be the sign of the slope coefficients?
- Which of the regression would be a better fit?
- If we ran a regression of body_fat with TWO explanatory variables abdomen AND wkg, what would be the sign of the coefficient on wkg?  
- https://flux.qa/LDPPHD

##Question 4: verification of question 3

- Now let's actually run these regression and see what we get:
1. Estimate $body\_fat = \beta_0 + \beta_1wkg$
2. Estimate $body\_fat = \delta_0 + \delta_1abdomen$
3. Estimate $body\_fat = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1abdomen + \gamma_2wkg$
- Why is the sign of the coefficient on wkg negative in the third regression?
- If weight was measured in pounds rather than in kilograms, how would the coefficients change in regression 3? https://flux.qa/LDPPHD
